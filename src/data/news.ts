      "Anfa Park held three stages this year, with the main stage running from early evening until the small hours and the Jazz Club programming a quieter, seated room for the second half of each night. The makers' market returned with twice the number of stalls, and the food court moved to the eastern edge of the park to give the crowd more room to move between sets.",
      "Audiences travelled from across Morocco and beyond: a quarter of ticket holders came from outside Casablanca, and one in ten from outside the country. The festival's own wristband payments meant shorter queues at the bars, with the average wait down to under three minutes across the ten days.",
